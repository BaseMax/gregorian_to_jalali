## Philosophy

2 years ago, I created a repository to archive minimal solution for convert a gregorian date to jalali [PHPJalaliDate avaiable at here](https://github.com/BaseMax/PHPJalaliDate).

But Here, I want to keep minimal solution for most programming languages.
I think in most case we not need a very large library just to convert a date, so these solutions can help everyone in that way.

## Contribute

Feel free to improve/change or add a new solution for languages.

### TODO

- Add more test cases
